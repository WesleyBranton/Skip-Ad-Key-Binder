# Skip Ad Key Binder [<img align="right" src=".github/fxaddon.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/skip-ad-key-binder/)
The Skip Ad Key Binder add-on will connect your keyboard's next track key to the skip ad button that displays on skippable YouTube advertisements. This allows users to easily skip ads on videos when watching videos on a second monitor or second window.

If add-on will only work for users who have media keys available on their keyboards that work with Firefox.
